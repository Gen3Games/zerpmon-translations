# Zerpmon Web App Translations

##### Notes for translators
1. Please be careful with your commits we pull them automatically and directly into the web app. Any mistakes will make their way into production
2. The main thing we should avoid is to change the variable names and structures
3. Currently we use original forms for brand names. Things like Xumm/Xaman, Crossmark, Zerpmon are ideally preserved.
4. If not sure what the variable name is for, please refer to English translation
